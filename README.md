# Battleship
Implementation of Battleship in C++ as the final project for a 3rd year university module "Object-Oriented Programming in C++". I also added my own modifications to the game.

## Modifications
During a players' turn, they choose a ship to attack with.
Each ship is assigned a range which restricts the rows on the board it is able to attack.
Each ship also has a limited amount of ammunition.
A ships would be unable to attack if is has been sunk or has run out of ammunition.

## Future Work
Future work may include:
- Design a bot to play the game against a human player
- Split the modifications I added as a seperate game mode
- Allow custom board sizes (might interfere with the range modification)
- Optimise code

## Built with
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) - IDE used

## Pull requests welcome!
My code is far from perfect and has lots more optimization that can be done. Spot any errors or have any improvement suggestions? Send a pull request!
