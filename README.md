# Battleship

Implementation of Battleship in C++ as the final project for a 3rd year university module "Object-Oriented Programming in C++". I also added my own modifications to the game. 


## Modifications
During a players' turn, they choose a ship to attack with.
Each ship is assigned a range which restricts the rows on the board it is able to attack.
Each ship also has a limited amount of ammunition.
A ships would be unable to attack if is has been sunk or has run out of ammunition.
